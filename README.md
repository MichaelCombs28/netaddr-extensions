netaddr-extensions
==================

A few utilities that extend the functionality of netaddr library,
mostly grabbing irregular cidr ranges, and a few other things.

--Note--
I've recently realized how little I actually knew about IPAddressing.
This module can showcase some of my Python programming and also, unfortunately, my inability
to understand logical networking. 

I'll leave this up to learn from my mistakes and grow as a programmer.
